- V1-V28 are the customer information that has been PCA transformed. The only information that are not transformed are Time and Transaction Amount

2. Implementation
- Scaled the Amount column so that it's scaled the same way as the rest of V1-V28 columns
- Built 3 models (KNN, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression)
- Evaluate the model using Accuracy Score and F1 Score
