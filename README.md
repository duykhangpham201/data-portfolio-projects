# Data Portfolio Projects

This repo consists of data analyst portfolio project that I haved worked and currently working on. As a data and web3 enthusiast, I hope that these projects demonstrate my skills and understanding of those subjects. So far, my Python projects have contained Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, ScikitLearn, and TensorFlow.

List of Projects:

1. [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/duykhangpham201/data-portfolio-projects/tree/master/credit-card-fraud)
* Used Python and Machine Learning to figure out the the model that predicts which transactions are fraud.

2. [Robo Advisor](https://github.com/duykhangpham201/data-portfolio-projects/tree/master/robo-advisor)
* Utilized Python and Data Analytic skills to clean & organize stock market and macroeconomic data.
* Built Neural Network models that predict stock and crypto prices given historical data.
* Applied the result to Modern Portfolio Theory to predict the best portfolio allocation given the investors' taste
