# Robo-Advisor Project

This project demonstrates the use of Python along with its data analysis packages (Numpy, Pandas, ScikitLearn, and TensorFlow).

1. CryptoPredictor.ipynb & StockPredictor.ipynb
- Use Numpy and Pandas to clean and organize data before analyzing.
- ScikitLearn and Tensorflow are used to build out the model that predict the Index prices 2 months into the future (with data from the previous 6 months).

2. RoboAdvisor.ipynb
- Load and join the previous models created above.
- Modern Portfolio Theory are used to give users the best portfolio allocation based on their risk tolerance.
